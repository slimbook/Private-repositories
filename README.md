We are a small hardware company that develops some applications, we have public repositories where you can help us with translations. But we also have private repositories where people who request it can collaborate.
This helps us to better control who collaborates and we avoid problems of the past.
Our applications are installed on our laptops, but also on other brand laptops.

If you want to collaborate, open an issue in this repository with your github account, and indicate in which app you want to collaborate, what you have in mind to do.
