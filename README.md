We are a small Spanish hardware manufacturer that invests some its time in to application development as well. You can contribute with translations for our apps via our public repositories.

On the other hand, we have set up private repositories too for those that wish to contribute with their coding skills. Private repositories allows us to better control who contributes what code to avoid some issues that we had to deal with in the past. You will find our apps included with our  computers, but they will work on most computers from any brand.

If you want to contribute, open an issue in this repo with your GitHub account and tell us which app you want to improve and what additions do you have in mind.

Welcome to Slimbook Dev Team!
